# WaterQualityAi
This project uses AI to determine if water is safe to drink. By analyzing key parameters such as pH, turbidity, hardness, and mineral levels, the system predicts water potability. Users can input data, and the AI provides a simple result indicating whether the water is drinkable, showcasing the practical application of AI in water quality analysis.
